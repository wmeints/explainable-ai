# Explainable AI Demo

This repository contains the code for the explainable AI talk that I've 
presented in a number of places. Feel free to explore the code and use it in 
your own projects.

## System requirements

You'll need the following tools on your system to use the code:

* [Python 3.8][PYTHON]
* [Poetry][POETRY]

## Getting started

Please use the following commands to prepare the repository for use:

* `git clone https://github.com/wmeints/explainable-ai`
* `cd explainable-ai`
* `poetry install`
* `poetry shell`

By executing these commands you're cloning the code to your harddrive,
installing the dependencies and activating a shell for the project.

After you've completed these steps you can open the code in Visual Studio Code
by executing the following command in the shell you just opened:

```shell
code .
```

Open the file `notebooks\explain-model.ipynb` to get started exploring the code.
